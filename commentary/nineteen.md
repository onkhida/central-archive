I spend a great deal of time talking about how I feel and a lot of it happens in the entries that I write in my private journal. It’s usually an outpouring, a stream of consciousness I release to log my current mental state. It’s also usually sporadic and irregular—as each entry manifests from whatever strong emotion I might’ve been experiencing at that time: joy, anger, sadness, nostalgia, anything. The blobs of text are just things my fingers type out because my head has become saturated and needs a release. If I’m lucky, this happens about 9 times a month, or twice a week.

The power outages got a lot worse this month. It’s always been really poor, but this time, the timing felt so erratic that I wasn’t able to figure out a coherent pattern of when they were to give us electricity. Yesterday felt specifically horrible because power didn’t come throughout the night, and as I had taken a nap midday, I couldn’t really force myself to sleep until daybreak. And I couldn’t work either because all my electronics were dead, with the only light source coming from a dimly lit rechargeable torch I had set up on the desk in my room. So, consumed by this dimness and trademark Nigerian humidity, I began to read through all the entries I had logged in my journal.

Reading it back was interesting, especially the entries put together over 6 months ago. It was funny to see how much text I’d put down in that notebook, the way I had made a habit of logging my emotions in their entirety whenever I felt them. I read back everything: things written in anger, despair, happiness, sadness, anxiety. Everything. It’s an incredible experience observing how often one’s mind ebbs, flows, and morphs through time. But what I believe struck me the most was how ephemeral it all seemed. Somedays I was angry; some days I was sad. Somedays I was nervous, frustrated, excited, hurt, or overwhelmed. The interesting part about writing so much for such a long time is that whilst the entries are always unique because the context always differs, it reaches a point where things could feel repetitive. I said I was happy on January 21st, likewise 3 months ago in February. Just last week, I had also written that I was happy, and when the day winds down today, I will tell my journal that I am happy once again.

Today, I completed my 19th dance around the sun. Honestly, it’s great that my birthday has come around at a time when I’ve been thinking a lot about repetition, and how fleeting emotions can be. I’m also especially pleased because I have finally concluded that [Holocene](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ILEK6NRfxoseoPnolRcVA?si=c6ab8ebd95f045e6) by [Bon Iver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Iver) is the best song to ever exist. It’s been lurking around my top spot for a bit now, but I can confidently say that it is the pinnacle of creative expression. And it’s not just that Justin Vernon’s falsetto is sonically ethereal, Holocene explores a theme that really excites me: ephemeral states & transitive experiences.

When Vernon cries “I was not magnificent” at the chorus, a small part of me gets lighter because a lot of what I speculate that he means ties into much of what I’ve been thinking—and in this entry writing—about. I don’t have a lot of first-hand context, and my interpretations of the song could be purely guesswork, but it does feel like he’s expressing an understanding of his relative “insignificance”, and I think that that’s really beautiful.

Humans are only around for so long, and even the grandest of lifetimes can still feel a bit meagre in the large scheme of things. It is easy to feel like a brief dot, a footnote in the history of a planet that has been around for an incredible amount of time. Still, throughout my lifetime, the chances are that I will experience all the emotions I’ve written about in my journal (though in differing contexts) again and again and again. Whether that is anger, happiness, anxiety, fear, despair, or sadness, I will feel things, and I will often feel them intensely. Vernon’s cry highlighting his insignificance is really special to me because it renders a beautiful reminder that everything is temporary. The emotions I feel will fade, and come again, and fade, until I too ultimately fade.

There’s a part of me that initially argued that this realisation or hyperawareness of how trivial a lot of things are was unhealthy to internalise, but there is a much larger part of me that believes that thinking about these things may be a positive. Vernon’s cry, and all that I have realised reading my journal, is a profound motivation for me to feel, and to do so intensely. Because our existence as humans is incredibly short, I intend to revel in those things that make me human. When the emotions are pleasant, I am going to try my hardest to feel it all, to stay in the moment and experience that warmth because I know that it will ultimately wane. Likewise, when there is angst in my chest, I will still feel it out. I intend to take it as part of my human experience while keeping in mind that despair dissipates, and that gloomy clouds fade away—like all things always do.
