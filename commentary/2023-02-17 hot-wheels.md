I went cycling this evening! I probably haven’t ridden a bike in almost 5 years, but I suppose your legs never really forget the pedaling motion that helps you move forward. It felt great as well, and I think this was infinitely more enjoyable than my daily attempt at doing 3km in less than 10 minutes (I have a long way to go till I hit that).

My evenings have quickly become the best times to take breathers. For the majority of the day, there’s an activity to be done: friends to call, football games to watch or recipes to learn. Or sometimes just by virtue of being around my parents, I find myself working on a task that’s just been given to me. Going out definitely helps me slow down, and the low intensity cycling puts me in the reflective mood necessary to make some sense of the day that I've just had. My evening cycling session has made me understand how important this all is—the breathers, the slow and sober moments that help you recollect and sync with your being. Most days I'm travelling too fast. My mind is moving at 600 mph and I'm trying so hard to tick off tasks daily like I'm running out of time. I suppose sometimes it's alright to sit idle, and let my thoughts be punctuated by the constant whir and shackle of my bike’s pedaling chain.
