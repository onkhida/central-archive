Arsenal’s [game](https://youtu.be/2jQTitvTeVw?si=6KkeYIRPsulAbBzJ) against Newcastle yesterday had some of the prettiest buildup sequences I've seen in a while. There's something incredibly satisfying about evading the initial opposition press and using the space left behind to create scoring chances. There's probably been prettier sequences in this match week, but yesterday's victory gave me an unbelievable amount of dopamine, so I'll stick with that as the top spot.

Joel and I've been talking a lot about discomfort. In many ways, it seems to be the theme of my past year. I've found myself worrying more than I need to, and despite the growth I've experienced, a lot of the spaces I've found myself in have made me feel a lot of angst. However, it's not just this past year that's felt retrospectively difficult. Throughout my life, in general, I have had a lot of experiences. I'm lucky that there's been a lot of good in it, but like most people, there are parts of what I've experienced that have also been negative. There's been a lot of discomfort, and angst, and there's a tiny bit that falls under the traumatic category.

Very often though when I do talk about my discomfort, I tend to surround it with some rationale, or some reasoning as to why that's being experienced. It's like my brain's treating the scenarios like an opposition's press, and I'm somehow really good at convincing myself that it's an opportunity to showcase my mettle, my tenacity to overcome what it is I'm experiencing. I suppose it's not even a new feeling either. There's a lot of pain in this world, and just by being born on this planet, experiencing that pain is inevitable. I suppose romanticising negative experiences is the way humans have come to make themselves feel better. When surrounded by discomfort, it weirdly makes sense to convince myself that it's making me stronger, and smarter and that I need it to become who I'm meant to be.

In many cases, I suppose that's right. Experiences can shape us, and perhaps it is fruitful to keep a mindset that makes you believe that you can make something out of even the most dire situations. I’m just trying to be more aware of when I take it too far and start creating arguments that minimise whatever I’m feeling because I’m hyper-fixated on always turning my lemons into lemonade. I’m still searching for what a healthier processing of my emotions may feel like, though I do hope that I find it soon.
