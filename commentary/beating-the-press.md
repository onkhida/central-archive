The Arsenalâ€™s [game](https://youtu.be/2jQTitvTeVw?si=6KkeYIRPsulAbBzJ) against Newcastle yesterday had some of the prettiest buildup sequences I've seen in a while. There is something incredibly satisfying about evading the initial opposition press and using the space left behind to create chances. There's probably been prettier though (even in this match week), but yesterday's victory gave me an unbelievable amount of dopamine so I will stick with that as the top spot.

[Joel](https://twitter.com/joeladejola) and I have been talking a lot about discomfort. In many ways, it seems to be the theme of the past year, and despite the growth I've experienced, I would be lying if I said that it was all smooth sailing. Though it's not even this past year that has been a task to navigate. Across my life in general, there have been a lot of experiences. I am very lucky that there's been a lot of good in it. But, much like most people, there is still a fair share of my experiences that felt initially uncomfortable.

Very often though when I do talk about my discomfort, I tend to surround it with some rationale, or some reasoning as to why that's being experienced. It's like my brain's treating the scenarios like an opposition's press. I'm somehow really good at convincing myself that it's an opportunity to showcase my mettle, my tenacity to overcome what it is being experienced. I suppose what I do is not even unique either. There is a lot of discomfort in this world, and just by being born on this planet, experiencing that discomfort is inevitable. I suppose rationalizing sub-optimal experiences is the way humans have come to make themselves feel better. When surrounded by discomfort, it weirdly makes sense to convince yourself that it is making you stronger, and smarter and that it is needed to become who you are meant to be.

In many cases that is probably right. Growing pains do exist. Experiences do often shape us, and even the negative ones have the potential to make us better people. I think I am just trying to toe the line in a healthier way, really. I am trying to develop a good framework without swinging the pendulum too far in either direction. What does that look like now? I am not sure at the moment, but it is something I am trying to figure out soon.
