[Chimfeka](https://aforawoke.com/) asked why I had a commentary page yesterday and I struggled to give a coherent answer. I eventually gave one but it was so underwhelming I don’t even remember what it is I said at that time. I’ve called it underwhelming because the decision to put [commentary](https://www.danieleta.com/commentary) pieces up was quite intentional but for some reason I really struggled to articulate it to someone else. I want to briefly do that here.

I have not been writing code for a remarkably long time (been about 6 years), but I can identify the integration of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) into my workflow as a true inflection point. Nowadays, it’s an indispensable part of how I develop things: if I’m working on a website and at some point decide to add, say a [media query](https://www.danieleta.com/c/media-queries) to a CSS script, I can simply [add](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes) the changed file(s) to the staging area and then make a [commit](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)>) describing what the change is that I’ve made and possibly how I’ve implemented it. Across the project lifecycle, these commits become an incredible log of how the repository may have morphed and changed. It’s like having a time machine that allows me to reference different points throughout development to get an overall sense/idea of what the source code looked like then.

This simplified explanation above of how I use git in a project setting is something I want my commentary page to replicate. What I mean is that I’m viewing myself (or my consciousness) as a repository or project being worked on. The files and the source code in general are fleeting thoughts that swarm around within me from time to time. Whenever these feelings present themselves strongly, putting them on the commentary segment is my way of making a commit to the repository (that is me).

I am a work in progress, and there are so many more levels I have to go. I expect my thoughts, feelings, psyche and understanding of things to morph and change over time. These entries that I try to churn out whenever I can help me create a log of my development across space and time (just like how commits in a GitHub repo can give you a really nice description of how a project has developed up until a certain point). Now why is this log useful to me? I’ve come to understand how human it is to err. I don’t expect a lot of the things I’ve written [here](https://www.danieleta.com/commentary) so far to be entirely correct, truthful or precise. In fact, I’m sure that if I revisit some entries, I would be able to identify things I no longer think are correct/true. This is because time has passed (albeit a few months) since writing some of these entries and being able to construct (new) distinct thoughts about things is a natural by-product of a person’s mental changing over time. Having this log helps me sniff out sub-optimal heuristics that I once leaned into. It's a place to challenge, revisit, rework and re-evaluate things on a consistent basis (like I would on a code repository).

And so in a large way, this is not a blog. I am not really doing this for an audience. I’m logging a lot of this for my future self to re-explore and re-evaluate. Like [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net/about#target-audience) (who started this long before me), I find the task of writing things I currently think are interesting for a different me in the future quite exciting. There’s probably a lot of advantages too. For one, revisiting things I’ve penned down can lead to epiphanies like [this](https://www.danieleta.com/c/nineteen) one, and concerning writing quality, [Joel](https://twitter.com/joeladejola) makes me understand that being able to sit and cringe at sentences constructed months ago is a helpful indicator of growth.

But why is this “repository” of mine public? I could very well write and review these in private, right? The answer I gave [here](https://www.danieleta.com/commentary) was that it was to give my site some personality. To some extent this is true, but even more so, writing and deploying entries on a site that is publicly accessible to people is me subtly practicing how to [take up space](https://www.danieleta.com/c/centre-forward-play). I also don’t think I’ve ever finished writing any entry. Whenever I think I’m done with a markdown file, there’s a consistent niggling feeling at the back of my head that thinks I could have done more, or constructed the paragraphs in a better way. Publishing these things online is my way of beating the critic that resides in my head, and accepting that nothing can ever really be perfect. I want this acceptance to seep into other areas of my life too, especially when it comes to shipping software. I want to become comfortable with shipping something quickly, and then continuously improving it over time.

I also must say that the experience of going from development to deployment is a good one. It’s really satisfying when I’m able to beat the initial ambiguity that comes from starting to arrive at the finish line. I experience this a lot when I’m writing code. The problem often feels vague, ill-defined and confusing. Still, more often than not keeping at it leads to fruition. Writing these entries also mimics that: I usually have a vague idea of what it is I want to say, but the concreteness only comes after reworking several sentences and paragraphs recursively.

So I want to puncture space and time with these commits for as long as I can. And for my future self, for the habits I want to form, [for my ability to think and create](https://michaelnotebook.com/wn/website_enhance.html), and for the transformative process that I envision consistent writing can bring with it.
